# Week .03

**February 9**

This week they showed us the history of the Laser & vinyl cutter and how does they work. the different types of materials that can be cutted in the laser, such as wook, vinyl, cardboard, non-toxic leather, etc. It's power, speed & frequency.
Meaning tthat if you adjust the following parameters, it will determine the depth to which the laser will cut:
Power: the percentage of power used by the laser.
Speed: the speed at which the laser carriage moves throught its job.
PPI (Frequency): The firing rate of the laser as it moves (pulse per inch).

Raster, Engraving & Cutting, the work that the laser can do. Raster is like making and image without deepening the line; engraving, is deepening the line without cutting it; & finally, cutting.

Just using the black color to raster. Cutting the inner cut and after that cutting the outter cut of the design.

Format; vector/raster

## Assignment:
Create a paraemtric desgin 
like a box or something
and if you want, you can use the vinyl cutter


 cut something on the vinylcutter
      design, lasercut, and document a parametric construction kit,
         accounting for the lasercutter kerf,
         which can be assembled in multiple ways,
         and for extra credit include elements that aren't flat
