# Remixing Materials w/ Lara Campos

As exploratory material, I have decided to opt for creating bio-threads. For two years now, I have immersed myself in the world of research into materials based on organic waste. Bio-threads as such can be created with sodium alginate and calcium chloride, together with water. Pigments or other waste can be added to help its formation. I had never tried to create bio-threads before, since last December I participated in a workshop with an Argentine researcher named Carolina Etchevers. After this workshop, my interest in continuing to explore biothreads intensified and now I would like to continue exploring them.
Lara has a project called 'Be Grounded' that she did for Fabriacademy in 2019 where she knitted seeds into yarn filaments. That made me wonder if it would be possible to create natural-based threads that could grow food plants to be able to create street sculptures and occupy public spaces to be able to cultivate. Below, my first try of making bio-threads.
