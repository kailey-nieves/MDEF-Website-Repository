I think it is very interesting in the way that we enter different branches in Bio-Zero. Exciting to be able to grow micro-organisms from things we find.

Growing spirulina and kombucha were the two things that most motivated and captivated me. It is not my first time working with kombucha, as I have become scoby sane. but, to return to the concept of cultivating it with others, I really liked it. Furthermore, spirulina had never grown before and neither did I know that it was used as food.
After this, the exercise of looking for things outside to see them under a microscope was fun. I carried a hundred foot dead that I had killed the day before and seeing its textures and colors was fascinating.
