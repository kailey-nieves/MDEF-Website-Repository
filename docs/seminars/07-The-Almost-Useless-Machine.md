WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED 2 DO?_

Create an almost useless machine based on recycled materials from other machines, in particular those that we had dismantled the previous week, mega entertaining. We used a fan and a tv screen to make the machine, and build a a three-floor platform with cardboard that was created with Rhino and the cut in the Laser Machine. Although, I think the exercise was still a bit stressful because we only had two days to create the machine and make it work. I can comment that perhaps it could have been a better distribution of the groups, so that there was a more adequate balance in terms of the abilities of each person and all the groups. But nothing, I think that despite everything, the exercise was great. Our working group decided to make a machine around the word alone / loneliness. A machine to detect how happy  do you wanna feel that day. As for the other machines created, I think the concepts were great and they created very fun things. It was very diverse in the way we chose the pieces and decided to reuse them for our artifact.
