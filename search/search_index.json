I consider myself as a designer, puppeteer, agroecologist and multidisciplinary queer artist; anti-capitalist transfeminist defender of LGBTTIQ + rights. I am from a small island in the Caribbean called Puerto Rico, where I obtained a university degree in the studies of feminized bodies through design and performance. In my personal practice for some years now, I have done a lot of work with my hands such as sewing, ceramics, crafting with reused objects and farming.
