But what about it in particular is or was that we did not know. He told me that he wanted to make a concept map to see if he could get something from it and that idea make me to do the same exercise but at home, including my two roommates/friends. To give a bit of context, my two roommates are from Puerto Rico, just like me. In addition to that, one of them is studying Agroecology and the other, Studies of women and gender at the Faculty of Geography but with knowledge in feminist ecology, both at the University of Barcelona. Therefore, what better help than three minds and bodies that come from the same context, from a small island in the Caribbean that is still a colony of the United States and that are studying things related? This is our concept map in the house, about things that revolve around the word \u201cAgriculture\u201d. Although I think I still have things to experiments in order to have an idea of where I want to go with agriculture, I decided to start by experimenting on the possibilities of creating toys with biomaterial. 01 Experiment: Biomaterial puppets As a puppeteer, I see importance in the development of toys for children and in my personal practice, I use recycled materials, whether organic, plastics, etc. to include any type of person with or without crafting / art skills. With this, I prioritize creating them at home with the things we have, to reduce expenses and material consumption. When we went to Collserola Natural Park to hike, while we were going down, I realized the amount of children\u2019s toys that had been discarded without having previously thought about the possibility of recycling and transforming them or making exchanges among other children or giving them to organizations that collect them or others. So, keeping in mind my recycling practices, that even though I reused materials if I discarded it, there would also be a possibility that it would end up in the same place where these toys ended up. I don\u2019t want a toy of mine to end up causing more damage just by crafting it. How can I end the life of my toy without doing more damage to the earth? Makinf it with Biomaterials.

When I applied to this master I had an idea of what I wanted to do, work with biomaterials & farming. When the Pre-Course started, I suddenly got lost in the sea of information they were sharing with me because I had no idea what they were talking about. Electronics, I have never in my life been in a class to do coding or work with rhino. I thought I was in the wrong place for a moment, so I gave myself the opportunity to calm down, at least try to understand what I was learning, and everything flowed even though I was still questioning myself why I was there. Once the bootcamp started, I was able to look back and ask myself the same question as to why I was there and what my interests were; my answer did not change, I continue with a view to working on biomaterials. The bootcamp opened the way to do a reflection of our interior, putting on paper what are the things that interest us and what are our attitudes in our present, emphasizing again and again that my work is in manual work / handcrafts. This being the portal of the use of reused materials, \u201cgarbage\u201d, clay, living organisms, among others. And I saw myself again, to feel safe to be in such a diverse space and without questioning why I was there as the only visual artist. Above, a personal illustration of my skills, knowledges & attitudes. Below, the chart of the skills, knowledge & attitudes I will like to have after each seminar.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Kai\u2019s Main Signals: Bio-culture/materials The fight that I presented a week ago was a bit related to the access of information that lacks in my country of alternates forms of living sustainable and the use of organic wastes for the creation of new materials. By lack of access to information, I do not mean that they limit us access to internet for political reasons, is that there are no tools or education to promote these types of systems that have been gradually understood and created, to change our lifestyles and our environments. I chose for the seminar of Aows, Bio-culture/materials being the first one as the main signal and the second one, food apartheids. I did it because it collects everything that has to do with human behavior towards other living organisms, such as other animal, plants, etc. So why not understand these compartments from scratch to start with what we really want in order to create an impact. I took that sign because I think it encompasses everything I would like to rethink from where I am now, about how to grow our own food to how to make our own materials out of wastes. For me, this exercise was not as easy as it sounds. From what I could find through this diagram since we did the Collserola Natural Park hike and the way back to our home having this week signals on mind, was that in the neighborhood we were in and back to my home, there was a lot of food waste and a lot of plastic toys in the trash. What made me think with this first one, is the number of people who live without being able to eat and how we could do to stop wasting so much food or the alternative of growing our own food at home and not so much at home, it can also be rethinking our spaces of urban gardens as spaces for community food. In the second, which are the toys, I wondered a lot if there are organizations or companies that collect discarded toys to create other things or even new toys. So, I came home after observing these things in the different neighborhoods and I sat down at home to think about what I just said and what I could do about it. In my house we are 3 people, therefore we have a lot of organic waste that we collect and then dispose in the garbage cans, which does not make sense because we do not know what they do with that organic waste that people throw there. We do not know if they discard it in the same place where they dispose of regular garbage. Therefore, I began to wonder if the best alternative was to separate the uncooked waste from the cooked waste, so that we could create a compost system and create our own land to grow at home. It was very interesting to share the things that I had thought or seen with people who have interests like mine and who can also contribute to things that I had not contemplated or the same vice versa, they not having contemplated it. The group was \u201ccalled\u201d or rather it went towards the subject of the post-consumer and one of the topics that resonated a lot was food, either as waste or literally as a source of food, and what could be an impact as regenerative design. By this week work I would like to be able to contact people who give or do permaculture and / or botany. in addition to people who work with growing food for communities and who have a waste system either for themselves and / or for the community. And I would like to experiment with lichens and mycelium or any sort of organism that can give me the tools to build a sustainable source of food. Maybe building a biomaterial that gives food if you discard it. Or maybe finding a way to create or know a fungi or bacteria that eats plastic. I just know that I want to keep experimenting with different kind of biomaterials and growing food. The new skill that I would like to add to my personal development plan is knowing bacteria and fungi and plants as essentials organisms in our system. How to identify them and knowing for what they can be used for and creating biomaterials with them. I would also like to add the fact of being able to contribute and / or direct people who do not know how to cultivate at home and the possibilities they have. Finally, I would like to add as a skill in my personal plan, to be capable enough to create a project that integrates my interests such as biomaterials and agriculture.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"seminars/03-Bio-Zero/","text":"Bio-Zero \u00b6","title":"Bio-Zero"},{"location":"seminars/03-Bio-Zero/#bio-zero","text":"","title":"Bio-Zero"},{"location":"seminars/04-Agri-Zero/","text":"Agri-Zero \u00b6 Why do we want to change agriculture?","title":"Agri-Zero"},{"location":"seminars/04-Agri-Zero/#agri-zero","text":"","title":"Agri-Zero"},{"location":"seminars/05-Living-with-your-own-ideas/","text":"Living with your own ideas \u00b6 A drawing of myself in 3 seconds & the meaning of my magical machine: My machine: Solar Punk Group: Group Reflection: The interventions in the group revolve around various discourses one makes, in search for identity of oneself.
