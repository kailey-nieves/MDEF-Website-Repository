When I applied to this master I had an idea of what I wanted to do, work with biomaterials & farming. When the Pre-Course started, I suddenly got lost in the sea of information they were sharing with me because I had no idea what they were talking about. Electronics, I have never in my life been in a class to do coding or work with rhino. I thought I was in the wrong place for a moment, so I gave myself the opportunity to calm down, at least try to understand what I was learning, and everything flowed even though I was still questioning myself why I was there. Once the bootcamp started, I was able to look back and ask myself the same question as to why I was there and what my interests were; my answer did not change, I continue with a view to working on biomaterials. The bootcamp opened the way to do a reflection of our interior, putting on paper what are the things that interest us and what are our attitudes in our present, emphasizing again and again that my work is in manual work / handcrafts. This being the portal of the use of reused materials, \u201cgarbage\u201d, clay, living organisms, among others. And I saw myself again, to feel safe to be in such a diverse space and without questioning why I was there as the only visual artist. Above, a personal illustration of my skills, knowledges & attitudes. Below, the chart of the skills, knowledge & attitudes I will like to have after each seminar.","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"","title":"Bootcamp"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","text":"Atlas of Weak Signals \u00b6 Kai\u2019s Main Signals: Bio-culture/materials The fight that I presented a week ago was a bit related to the access of information that lacks in my country of alternates forms of living sustainable and the use of organic wastes for the creation of new materials. By lack of access to information, I do not mean that they limit us access to internet for political reasons, is that there are no tools or education to promote these types of systems that have been gradually understood and created, to change our lifestyles and our environments. I chose for the seminar of Aows, Bio-culture/materials being the first one as the main signal and the second one, food apartheids. I did it because it collects everything that has to do with human behavior towards other living organisms, such as other animal, plants, etc. So why not understand these compartments from scratch to start with what we really want in order to create an impact. I took that sign because I think it encompasses everything I would like to rethink from where I am now, about how to grow our own food to how to make our own materials out of wastes. For me, this exercise was not as easy as it sounds. From what I could find through this diagram since we did the Collserola Natural Park hike and the way back to our home having this week signals on mind, was that in the neighborhood we were in and back to my home, there was a lot of food waste and a lot of plastic toys in the trash. What made me think with this first one, is the number of people who live without being able to eat and how we could do to stop wasting so much food or the alternative of growing our own food at home and not so much at home, it can also be rethinking our spaces of urban gardens as spaces for community food. In the second, which are the toys, I wondered a lot if there are organizations or companies that collect discarded toys to create other things or even new toys. So, I came home after observing these things in the different neighborhoods and I sat down at home to think about what I just said and what I could do about it. In my house we are 3 people, therefore we have a lot of organic waste that we collect and then dispose in the garbage cans, which does not make sense because we do not know what they do with that organic waste that people throw there. We do not know if they discard it in the same place where they dispose of regular garbage. Therefore, I began to wonder if the best alternative was to separate the uncooked waste from the cooked waste, so that we could create a compost system and create our own land to grow at home. It was very interesting to share the things that I had thought or seen with people who have interests like mine and who can also contribute to things that I had not contemplated or the same vice versa, they not having contemplated it. The group was \u201ccalled\u201d or rather it went towards the subject of the post-consumer and one of the topics that resonated a lot was food, either as waste or literally as a source of food, and what could be an impact as regenerative design. By this week work I would like to be able to contact people who give or do permaculture and / or botany. in addition to people who work with growing food for communities and who have a waste system either for themselves and / or for the community. And I would like to experiment with lichens and mycelium or any sort of organism that can give me the tools to build a sustainable source of food. Maybe building a biomaterial that gives food if you discard it. Or maybe finding a way to create or know a fungi or bacteria that eats plastic. I just know that I want to keep experimenting with different kind of biomaterials and growing food. The new skill that I would like to add to my personal development plan is knowing bacteria and fungi and plants as essentials organisms in our system. How to identify them and knowing for what they can be used for and creating biomaterials with them. I would also like to add the fact of being able to contribute and / or direct people who do not know how to cultivate at home and the possibilities they have. Finally, I would like to add as a skill in my personal plan, to be capable enough to create a project that integrates my interests such as biomaterials and agriculture.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"seminars/03-Bio-Zero/","text":"Bio-Zero \u00b6 This week was very interesting by the way we entered different branches in general science.

Steps taken ::: Research we carried out, i.e. Separating the components by type, searching for specific parts datasheets. Link datasheets and other relative documents. ::: The unit was plugged in to an electrical outlet. Result: No signs of life. The screws in the bottom cover were removed. The bottom cover was removed. The capacitors were discharged. The screws holding the circuit boards in place were removed. The circuit boards were wrmoved from the bottom cover. The sleeve on the input fuse was cut and removed. Result: the fuse was intact. The thermal paste was cleaned from the temperature probe. The heat shrink around the input torroid was removed to reveal the loops of wire. The Fan was unplugged and removed. The induction coil was disconnected and removed. The iser interface circuit board was unplugged and removed. The heat sink was removed and the thermal paste was cleaned off The heat shrink was cut and removed from the induction coil terminals to reveal the crimped connectors.

We thought it would be quite a practical way of checking the availability of IAAC spaces and counting people. However, a physical intervention would have been also an appropriate means to collect data for our case. Tool \ud83d\udd27 usage documentation: We used the PiCamera to create timelapses in two different ways: - POV timelapse: the camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC. - Static timelapse: the camera was static in a specific place and captured everything that happened there. For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px) in order not to have heavy files. We also set the photo frequency to 1 picture per second to have enough information from people\u2019s movements. Data capturing strategy: Our strategy consisted of two main points: The first one was based on checking the different spaces of IAAC with the camera during lunchtime and seeing if there was people eating inside. Thanks to this, we could get information for both of our hypothesis. The second one focused on testing the interest of people around a poster in the entrance communicating a supposed \u201cLunch Room\u201d at IAAC\u2019s main hall. This would let us know about support for this idea. Also, we had to change the strategy in the middle of the data collection since the PiCamera stopped working. Our intention there was to count the amount of people going to eat outside during lunchtime compared to the total of people at IAAC. However, we believe this wasn\u2019t a major problem for our research. Materials needed: Picamera, \u201cLunchRoom\u201d poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms. Detail setup instructions: Data collected Describe the raw data you collected by posting a sample i.e. a picture, a screen capture, etc. For privacy reasons we are not able to show the images captured by the Raspberry Pi.

REFLECTION I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lunch time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars/06-Tech-Beyond-The-Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"Tech Beyond the Myth Forensic Report: Princess Induction Cooker Group Data Recollection Data insights","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars/06-Tech-Beyond-The-Myth/#forensic-report-princess-induction-cooker-group","text":"::: Forensics of obsolescence confronts us with the results of today\u2019s consumers\u2019 electronics industry model.

How does it work? How it\u2019s built? Why it failed, or it wasn\u2019t used anymore? ::: Is it an induction cooker? How does it work? Is it broken? Can we fix it? What is inside? Steps taken ::: Research we carried out, i.e. Separating the components by type, searching for specific parts datasheets. Link datasheets and other relative documents. ::: The unit was plugged in to an electrical outlet. Result: No signs of life. The screws in the bottom cover were removed. The bottom cover was removed. The capacitors were discharged. The screws holding the circuit boards in place were removed. The circuit boards were wrmoved from the bottom cover. The sleeve on the input fuse was cut and removed. Result: the fuse was intact. The thermal paste was cleaned from the temperature probe. The heat shrink around the input torroid was removed to reveal the loops of wire. The Fan was unplugged and removed. The induction coil was disconnected and removed. The iser interface circuit board was unplugged and removed. The heat sink was removed and the thermal paste was cleaned off The heat shrink was cut and removed from the induction coil terminals to reveal the crimped connectors. The user interface circuit board was powered directly with a power supply. Result: No signs of life. Perhaps something on this board is causing the problem with the device not powering on. Results ::: Answers to the forensic questions. i.e. How many motors we find inside, does it contain a computer or microcontroller? Did the appliance failed, why? ::: Components: Induction coil Temperature probe Heat sink Power and control circuit board (YS-CP2-EMC) User interface circuit board (YSB-62) Top glass cover (heat resistant glass ceramic) Bottom plastic cover Fan (ZHI YUAN DC FAN ZY DC-18V) Power cable Failure mode: Unknown Electrical components: Induction heater capacitors Induction cooker chip (HIGHWAY13A) Inductor cooker chip (HIGHWAY DRV1201) beeper Conclusions ::: A summary of the overall report, in particular about the results. ::: At first nothing was working, so we disected it to see if any components were working, then we tried powering the user interface circuit board, which was not working. We got some components to turn on: the exhaust fan, the LED lights. Conclusion: It doesn\u2019t work. Inconclusive as to the culprit Opinions ::: What do you learn? What surprised you? ::: The copper coil is perhaps worth selling. The circuit boards look like a city. Learned about heat sinks. Noise filters. Something so simple is actually so complex. The user interface more interesting than expected.
