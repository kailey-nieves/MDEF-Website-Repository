The point was to test out different cutting and mold makingmaking techniques to realize the best results in terms of making successful stamps. We are already executing our interventions together, and we are working in the areas of creative uses of waste, specifically in children\u2019s toys and child play. We are currently working on building several toys made completely from waste and biodegradable materials in order to proceed with our interventions. PURPOSE \u00b6 Our artifact is a collection of stamps with exchangeable handles that kids can use to make drawings our map out graphics. We went for a simple object and decided not to reinvent the wheel, but rather, question the way it\u2019s made and challenge it. PLANNING AND EXECUTION \u00b6 As we are already have common values and aligned interests, it was easy for us to pick something and go with it. We then proceeded in writing down all the steps required to reach our final result. You can find the list below, and a thorough breakdown of the instructions to replicate the stamps. Overall, we had 4 main aspects to deal with: (1) design, (2) materials, (3) packaging, (4) finalizing + execution. DIAGRAM \u00b6 Here is a diagram to explain the main components that make up the stamps. DESIGN PROCESS \u00b6 The design process was focused on 3 main components: 1. Stamp drawing \u00b6 We drew the stamp as sketches in a notebook and later selected 7 designs. We then scanned and traced the designs on illustrator as vector drawings. 2. Handle design \u00b6 Same process as above, but a different design. 3. Stamp Base \u00b6 We had to think of the main shape of the stamp and the size of it, we also had to think of the way the different handles we designed can be replaced with each other by being attachable and removable from the stamp base. HONEST DESIGN \u00b6 We mainly focused on the laser cut machine for this exercise, and how we can create molds (whether negative or positive) from different materials through the laser cutting technique. We had also employed the press to produce melted plastic sheets for the stamp base and the handles. MATERIAL SOLUTIONS \u00b6 FOR THE STAMP Our main goal was to make the stamp part out of biomaterials (Agar and vinegar based, so we followed two different approaches and we present both results. (1) The first process consists of using mdf to make our desired shape, then use silicone to create a mold, which we would later pour into the biomaterials and create our stamps. (2) The other process required making a flat sheet of biomaterials and then inserting it in the laser to directly cut our shapes and glue them together. We had interesting results. However, before the silicone we tried to use clay as our mold, in order to be as eco friendly as possible, however, when inserting the biomaterials, it mixed with the mold as the air dry clay is water soluble, and the biomaterials contained water. FOR THE STAMP BASE AND HANDLE We had to collect and find plastics that are from the same composition. Then, we had to shred the plastic with the shredder into little pieces, and then melt them in an oven on a horizontal stable sheet and wait for it the sheet to dry. DESIGN BOUNDARIES \u00b6 We had to collect and find plastics that are from the same composition. Then, we had to shred the plastic with the shredder into little pieces, and then melt them in an oven on a horizontal stable sheet and wait for it the sheet to dry. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT \u00b6 For the future, we firstly would like to follow a few recipes and learn how to make colored ink from natural ingredients. We are also planning, as part of our design intervention, to take this kit to a kids\u2019 park and see how they interact with it. And finally, we hope to create a formula that is simplified, where we invite kids and their parents to \u201cfab playdates\u201d where we teach these kids and their parents how to easily create these stamps from wastes at home. These playdates would orbit around our common values which revolve around materials\u2019 second life and viewing waste as a resource, but most importantly, demonstrating to the young generations how they can be active agents and create their environment rather than just be consumers. REPLICABILITY \u00b6 Level of clarity and detail of the documentation material (photos, videos, text, etc) FABRICATION AND MATERIALS \u00b6 Materials: \u00b6 Feroca, Silicona de platino (easy plat) we used to do the molds in silicone. Mold Method: \u00b6 Molds of the shapes/bases: In the laser cutter machine, we \u2018cut\u2019 the shapes of the drawings of our stamps apart form the rectangle bases and after they were cutted, we glue them together. 1. Without the rectangle base in silicone: We used the wood stamps w/ an ice cube plastic tray to do a silicone mold. We mixed in equal parts, 1:1 We measured the volume of the spaces in the ice cube plastic tray that we were going to pour the mixture 1:1 of the silicone. Took the time to clean the tray and put the wood stamps at the bottom facing up. Then, divided the recipe of the silicone total in two; one for part A and one for part B (catalyzer). We joined the catalyzer in part A bowl & mixed it well for 10 min. to 12min, being careful not to create bubbles. After mixing well, we pour the mix on the spaces of the ice cube plastic tray. We it solidify for three-four hours. And finally, we took the mold that we did in silicone, out of the ice cube tray. 2. With the rectangle base in silicone:* We used some square molds made of wood that Lara had left us when we did the remixing materials workshop, covered them up with plastic and tape so that the material we wanted to pour on them did not leak out of the mold. After it, we taped the wood stamps that we did in the laser cutter and tapped them into the wooden part used as support. Mixed the 1:1 silicone recipe & pour it into the molde we made. Let it rest for 3-4 hours and then took it out of the mold. By putting the wooden stamp on the wooden mold, it created a type of \u201cstaircase\u201d in which the silicone mixture was covering each step because it was on a flat surface. That is why the mold was created rectangular with embossing on the drawing shape part. 3. With the rectangle base in air-dry clay: We used the wooden stamps that we laser cutted and we made an impression, compacting the stamp on the piece of clay. We let it dry for a couple of hours. Biomaterial Recipe: \u00b6 200ml. - Water - We used as an additive for the pigmentation of the material, seeds of annatto (boiled in water and a drop of oil, before). 10grs. - Agar Agar 2ml. - Vinegar 2grs. - Glicerine Shapes in Biomaterial: \u00b6 Alternative 01: Using the mold that we did in clay, it formed the shape with the drawing united with the base. We pour the biomaterial in it and let it dry for a couple of minutes. After it, we tried to take the material out of the clay mold but it did not work. We assumed that is because the clay absorbs water and it was like it didn\u2019t dry completely; even though that we let them there for two more hours and it was the same when we tried to took them out. Alternative 02: When we cutted the drawing shapes, we did a rectangle around them in order to take that negative piece out of the rest of the scraps & reuse it as a mold to pour biomaterials. We placed the negative wood piece of the shapes on top of wax paper and cover each of the sides with tape so that the material does not leak into the table that we used as support. After organizing our space, we cooked the biomaterial specified before & pouring it in our mold. Waited a few minutes until the biomaterial of Agar Agar was dry enough to remove from the wood mold. Took the material out w/ a fine ceramic utensil passing it around the edges so as not to break the material. Alternative 03: Using the mold of the ice cubes shapes that we did in silicone and w/ the same recipe of biomaterial we pour the mix on each one of the silicone ice cube. We let them dry for 5 minutes and took them out of the mold, having the just the shape as result. Alternative 04: Using the mold that we did in the square wood mold of Lara\u2019s workshop, we pour the biomaterial recipe wrote before & let the material dry for 5 minutes resulting in the shape of the engraved drawing united with the base in the form of a rectangle. Alternative 05: We used dried biomaterials made from agar agar in the fab lab before and pu ti in the machine to see if it worked working the design of our stamps. We cut them separately and then glue them together in order to have the drawing of the stamp and the base. Files \u00b6 [ADD LINK] design and fabrication files (open source or open format) Designs \u00b6 The design of the persons as an object that is used to hold the base of the stamp and to put the fingers in order for it to press and stamp, was made by Kai. Particularly they did the design for a Fab Academy course assignment that involved making a parametric design and Kai decided to make a carousel of people. We took the design with a view to reusing materials that we had on hand, and also because it is child friendly and cute. As we intended to reuse materials in the classroom or Iaac, in the last workshop of Remixing materials, different groups made a research of wastes and created biomaterials based on what they researched. D\u00eddac, Anna & Jeremy did research of the wastes that Iaac 3D printers were having and created sheets of melted plastics. We talked with them to see if they were going to use the sheets to do something and they told us that not all of them. So we send the person\u2019s file that Kai created on illustrator and George adjusted the measurements and created the bases to fit them to D\u00eddac and he helped us on laser cutting them. The designs of the drawings for the stamps, were made by hand by George. We took a picture of them downloaded and edited them on illustrator; we laser cut them in various materials such as agar agar and soap biomaterial sample made by Fab Lab, wood, and we did them too in biomaterials made by us from agar agar wit and without annato. BOM (bill of materials) \u00b6 Silicone Mdf - Wood Cardboard Biomaterials: Agar Agar, Vinegar, annatto, water Agar Agar & sopa biomaterial (made by fab lab) Problems \u00b6 We did our first mold he mold in clay, it formed the shape with the drawing united with the base. We pour the biomaterial in it and let it dry for a couple of minutes. After it, we tried to take the material out of the clay mold but it did not work. We assumed that is because the clay absorbs water and it was like it didn\u2019t dry completely; even though that we let them there for two more hours and it was the same when we tried to took them out. Anticipating the possible problems that this could cause us, we decided different methods of how to get the stamps of different molds. So we experimented with creating two different molds in silicone and using the negative pieces of the laser cut machine as a mold. And all of them worked. We cutted samples of agar agar biomaterial made in fab lab in the laser cut but some of them did not cut well or melted too much. So, we think that we need to test more samples of biomaterials in different properties on the laser cut that can lead us to a better cut of the material without it melting so much and cutting well. It helped us a lot, that we cutted three sheet of agar agar from fab lab and that we had a lot of biomaterial made out of different molds so as not to fall short.

Alternative 02: When we cutted the drawing shapes, we did a rectangle around them in order to take that negative piece out of the rest of the scraps & reuse it as a mold to pour biomaterials. We placed the negative wood piece of the shapes on top of wax paper and cover each of the sides with tape so that the material does not leak into the table that we used as support. After organizing our space, we cooked the biomaterial specified before & pouring it in our mold. Waited a few minutes until the biomaterial of Agar Agar was dry enough to remove from the wood mold. Took the material out w/ a fine ceramic utensil passing it around the edges so as not to break the material. Alternative 03: Using the mold of the ice cubes shapes that we did in silicone and w/ the same recipe of biomaterial we pour the mix on each one of the silicone ice cube. We let them dry for 5 minutes and took them out of the mold, having the just the shape as result. Alternative 04: Using the mold that we did in the square wood mold of Lara\u2019s workshop, we pour the biomaterial recipe wrote before & let the material dry for 5 minutes resulting in the shape of the engraved drawing united with the base in the form of a rectangle. Alternative 05: We used dried biomaterials made from agar agar in the fab lab before and pu ti in the machine to see if it worked working the design of our stamps. We cut them separately and then glue them together in order to have the drawing of the stamp and the base.","title":"Shapes in Biomaterial:"},{"location":"Fab-Academy/W%3A%2004.Challenge-Biostamps/#files","text":"[ADD LINK] design and fabrication files (open source or open format)","title":"Files"},{"location":"Fab-Academy/W%3A%2004.Challenge-Biostamps/#designs","text":"The design of the persons as an object that is used to hold the base of the stamp and to put the fingers in order for it to press and stamp, was made by Kai.

We took the design with a view to reusing materials that we had on hand, and also because it is child friendly and cute. As we intended to reuse materials in the classroom or Iaac, in the last workshop of Remixing materials, different groups made a research of wastes and created biomaterials based on what they researched. D\u00eddac, Anna & Jeremy did research of the wastes that Iaac 3D printers were having and created sheets of melted plastics. We talked with them to see if they were going to use the sheets to do something and they told us that not all of them. So we send the person\u2019s file that Kai created on illustrator and George adjusted the measurements and created the bases to fit them to D\u00eddac and he helped us on laser cutting them. The designs of the drawings for the stamps, were made by hand by George.

When I applied to this master I had an idea of what I wanted to do, work with biomaterials & farming. When the Pre-Course started, I suddenly got lost in the sea of information they were sharing with me because I had no idea what they were talking about. Electronics, I have never in my life been in a class to do coding or work with rhino. I thought I was in the wrong place for a moment, so I gave myself the opportunity to calm down, at least try to understand what I was learning, and everything flowed even though I was still questioning myself why I was there. Once the bootcamp started, I was able to look back and ask myself the same question as to why I was there and what my interests were; my answer did not change, I continue with a view to working on biomaterials. The bootcamp opened the way to do a reflection of our interior, putting on paper what are the things that interest us and what are our attitudes in our present, emphasizing again and again that my work is in manual work / handcrafts. This being the portal of the use of reused materials, \u201cgarbage\u201d, clay, living organisms, among others.

By lack of access to information, I do not mean that they limit us access to internet for political reasons, is that there are no tools or education to promote these types of systems that have been gradually understood and created, to change our lifestyles and our environments. I chose for the seminar of Aows, Bio-culture/materials being the first one as the main signal and the second one, food apartheids. I did it because it collects everything that has to do with human behavior towards other living organisms, such as other animal, plants, etc. So why not understand these compartments from scratch to start with what we really want in order to create an impact. I took that sign because I think it encompasses everything I would like to rethink from where I am now, about how to grow our own food to how to make our own materials out of wastes. For me, this exercise was not as easy as it sounds. From what I could find through this diagram since we did the Collserola Natural Park hike and the way back to our home having this week signals on mind, was that in the neighborhood we were in and back to my home, there was a lot of food waste and a lot of plastic toys in the trash. What made me think with this first one, is the number of people who live without being able to eat and how we could do to stop wasting so much food or the alternative of growing our own food at home and not so much at home, it can also be rethinking our spaces of urban gardens as spaces for community food. In the second, which are the toys, I wondered a lot if there are organizations or companies that collect discarded toys to create other things or even new toys. So, I came home after observing these things in the different neighborhoods and I sat down at home to think about what I just said and what I could do about it. In my house we are 3 people, therefore we have a lot of organic waste that we collect and then dispose in the garbage cans, which does not make sense because we do not know what they do with that organic waste that people throw there. We do not know if they discard it in the same place where they dispose of regular garbage. Therefore, I began to wonder if the best alternative was to separate the uncooked waste from the cooked waste, so that we could create a compost system and create our own land to grow at home. It was very interesting to share the things that I had thought or seen with people who have interests like mine and who can also contribute to things that I had not contemplated or the same vice versa, they not having contemplated it. The group was \u201ccalled\u201d or rather it went towards the subject of the post-consumer and one of the topics that resonated a lot was food, either as waste or literally as a source of food, and what could be an impact as regenerative design. By this week work I would like to be able to contact people who give or do permaculture and / or botany. in addition to people who work with growing food for communities and who have a waste system either for themselves and / or for the community. And I would like to experiment with lichens and mycelium or any sort of organism that can give me the tools to build a sustainable source of food. Maybe building a biomaterial that gives food if you discard it. Or maybe finding a way to create or know a fungi or bacteria that eats plastic. I just know that I want to keep experimenting with different kind of biomaterials and growing food. The new skill that I would like to add to my personal development plan is knowing bacteria and fungi and plants as essentials organisms in our system. How to identify them and knowing for what they can be used for and creating biomaterials with them. I would also like to add the fact of being able to contribute and / or direct people who do not know how to cultivate at home and the possibilities they have. Finally, I would like to add as a skill in my personal plan, to be capable enough to create a project that integrates my interests such as biomaterials and agriculture.","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/03-Bio-Zero/","text":"Bio-Zero \u00b6 This week was very interesting by the way we entered different branches in general science.

How? Non-selective Agar Medium strip to detect Aerobic Mesophilic Bacteria I search online about how to detect aerobic mesophilic bacteria and got to the tests of bacterias in cosmetics. What they perform is a test by diluting in a neutralized solution, at the same time the product is subjected to an enrichment culture to facilitate growth of some bacteria that may be represented in a low number. Dilutions of the product in neutralizing solution and enrichment culture is plate on solid non-selective agar medium (Non-selective media are intended to cultivate microorganisms in order to multiply them.

These are often mixed with agar and poured into Petri dishes to solidify. These agar plates provide a solid medium on which microbes may be cultured. They remain solid, as very few bacteria are able to decompose agar. Many microbes can also be grown in liquid cultures comprised of liquid nutrient media without agar\u201d. Spirulina & Kombucha Cultivation \u00b6 Growing spirulina and kombucha were the two things that most motivated and captivated me. It is not my first time working with kombucha, as I have become scoby mother for a while now. But, to return to the concept of cultivating it with others, I really liked it. Furthermore, I had never grown Spirulina before and neither did I know that it was used as food. I like cultivating kombucha to create leather after its process of growing. You can do a lot of stuff with it, that its a genius organic resource. As equal as Spirulina, you can use it for food, for your health or even though for organic dyes. We used microspcopes to see the bacterias that we cultivated by recollecting things inside or outside Iaac. It was ver stressful to see that stuff you commonly use, are highly contaminated with bacterias. After this, we got assigned to look for things outside Iaac to see them under a microscope and it was very fun. I carried a dead hundred foot insect that I had killed the day before and seeing its textures and colors with a microscope was fascinating and scary at the same time. Science paper \u00b6 Title: Biodegradation of bioplastics in natural environments Excessive production of petroleum-based plastics demands sustainable alternatives from renewable resources; 34 million tons of plastic wastes are generated each year throughout the world and 93% of them are disposed of in landfills and oceans. Thus, in order to create a sustainable environment and prevent the possible disposal of recalcitrant plastic wastes in the environment, production of bioplastics gained a lot of attention due to their biodegradability. Actually, the word bioplastic can refer either to bio-based plastics synthesized from biomass and renewable resources such as Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) or plastics produced from fossil fuel including aliphatic plastics like Polybutylene succinate (PBS), which can also be utilized as a substrate by microorganisms. In 2014, 1.7 million tons of bioplastics were produced through- out the world. The production of bioplastics is expected to reach 6.2 million tons in 2018. In 2012, PLA and starch-based were the most utilized bioplastics by 47 and 41% of total consumption, respectively. Moreover, Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) bioplastics got the attention of the scientific community due to their low CO2 emission. Although bioplastics are considered to be environmental friendly materials, they also have some limitations such as high production cost and poor mechanical properties. High production cost drawback can be managed by utilizing the low cost of renewable resources such as agricultural wastes. Among the bio-based plastics, Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) reveals optimum properties including high tensile strength and modulus. Poly (hydroxyalkonates) (PHAs) are their commercial competitors although they lack some optical and mechanical properties when compared to PLAs. The biodegradation of polymers consists of three important steps: (1) Biodeterioration, which is the modification of mechanical, chemical, and physical properties of the polymer due to the growth of microorganisms on or inside the surface of the polymers. (2) Biofragmentation, which is the conversion of polymers to oligomers and monomers by the action of microorganisms and (3) Assimilation where microorganisms are supplied by necessary carbon, energy and nutrient sources from the fragmentation of polymers and convert carbon of plastic to CO2, water and biomass. A huge amount of plastic wastes is disposed of in landfills which eventually leads to generation of greenhouse gases and leachate. Compostable plastic is \u201ca plastic that undergoes degradation by biological processes during composting to yield carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds, and biomass at a rate consistent with other known compostable materials and leaves no visually distinguishable or toxic residues\u201d Compostable plastic is biodegradable whereas a biodegradable plastic is not always compostable. Studying the biodegradation of PLA bioplastic under home composting conditions during 11 months showed a very slow biodegradation. This could be attributed to the lower temperature than that of the industrial scale trial which could be performed at a higher temperature range (Thermophilic). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956053X1630561X References: \u00b6 Dieckmann, R.

Many microbes can also be grown in liquid cultures comprised of liquid nutrient media without agar\u201d.","title":"iGEM Experiment"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/03-Bio-Zero/#spirulina-kombucha-cultivation","text":"Growing spirulina and kombucha were the two things that most motivated and captivated me. It is not my first time working with kombucha, as I have become scoby mother for a while now. But, to return to the concept of cultivating it with others, I really liked it. Furthermore, I had never grown Spirulina before and neither did I know that it was used as food. I like cultivating kombucha to create leather after its process of growing. You can do a lot of stuff with it, that its a genius organic resource. As equal as Spirulina, you can use it for food, for your health or even though for organic dyes. We used microspcopes to see the bacterias that we cultivated by recollecting things inside or outside Iaac. It was ver stressful to see that stuff you commonly use, are highly contaminated with bacterias. After this, we got assigned to look for things outside Iaac to see them under a microscope and it was very fun. I carried a dead hundred foot insect that I had killed the day before and seeing its textures and colors with a microscope was fascinating and scary at the same time.","title":"Spirulina &amp; Kombucha Cultivation"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/03-Bio-Zero/#science-paper","text":"Title: Biodegradation of bioplastics in natural environments Excessive production of petroleum-based plastics demands sustainable alternatives from renewable resources; 34 million tons of plastic wastes are generated each year throughout the world and 93% of them are disposed of in landfills and oceans. Thus, in order to create a sustainable environment and prevent the possible disposal of recalcitrant plastic wastes in the environment, production of bioplastics gained a lot of attention due to their biodegradability. Actually, the word bioplastic can refer either to bio-based plastics synthesized from biomass and renewable resources such as Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) or plastics produced from fossil fuel including aliphatic plastics like Polybutylene succinate (PBS), which can also be utilized as a substrate by microorganisms. In 2014, 1.7 million tons of bioplastics were produced through- out the world. The production of bioplastics is expected to reach 6.2 million tons in 2018. In 2012, PLA and starch-based were the most utilized bioplastics by 47 and 41% of total consumption, respectively. Moreover, Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) bioplastics got the attention of the scientific community due to their low CO2 emission. Although bioplastics are considered to be environmental friendly materials, they also have some limitations such as high production cost and poor mechanical properties. High production cost drawback can be managed by utilizing the low cost of renewable resources such as agricultural wastes. Among the bio-based plastics, Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) reveals optimum properties including high tensile strength and modulus. Poly (hydroxyalkonates) (PHAs) are their commercial competitors although they lack some optical and mechanical properties when compared to PLAs. The biodegradation of polymers consists of three important steps: (1) Biodeterioration, which is the modification of mechanical, chemical, and physical properties of the polymer due to the growth of microorganisms on or inside the surface of the polymers. (2) Biofragmentation, which is the conversion of polymers to oligomers and monomers by the action of microorganisms and (3) Assimilation where microorganisms are supplied by necessary carbon, energy and nutrient sources from the fragmentation of polymers and convert carbon of plastic to CO2, water and biomass. A huge amount of plastic wastes is disposed of in landfills which eventually leads to generation of greenhouse gases and leachate. Compostable plastic is \u201ca plastic that undergoes degradation by biological processes during composting to yield carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds, and biomass at a rate consistent with other known compostable materials and leaves no visually distinguishable or toxic residues\u201d Compostable plastic is biodegradable whereas a biodegradable plastic is not always compostable. Studying the biodegradation of PLA bioplastic under home composting conditions during 11 months showed a very slow biodegradation. This could be attributed to the lower temperature than that of the industrial scale trial which could be performed at a higher temperature range (Thermophilic). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0956053X1630561X","title":"Science paper"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/03-Bio-Zero/#references","text":"Dieckmann, R.

Andrea | D\u00eddac | Kai | Rei | Ruben From objectives to the hypothesis Brainstorming Multiple images about the brainstorming process: Project Goals Objective: I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC. Question: Are all spaces in IAAC in use at lunch time? Hypothesis: - Lunch&Afternoon Data \u201cThere is a space for a (covid-safe) lunch?\u201d - Morning Data \u201cAre there people in Iaac interested in having a space to have lunch?\u201d From hypothesis to data Tools selection We decided to choose the PiCamera as a tool for the experiment. We thought it would be quite a practical way of checking the availability of IAAC spaces and counting people. However, a physical intervention would have been also an appropriate means to collect data for our case. Tool \ud83d\udd27 usage documentation: We used the PiCamera to create timelapses in two different ways: - POV timelapse: the camera was taking pictures while we moved around the different spaces of IAAC. - Static timelapse: the camera was static in a specific place and captured everything that happened there. For the camera settings, we decided to use a low resolution (320x240px) in order not to have heavy files. We also set the photo frequency to 1 picture per second to have enough information from people\u2019s movements. Data capturing strategy: Our strategy consisted of two main points: The first one was based on checking the different spaces of IAAC with the camera during lunchtime and seeing if there was people eating inside. Thanks to this, we could get information for both of our hypothesis. The second one focused on testing the interest of people around a poster in the entrance communicating a supposed \u201cLunch Room\u201d at IAAC\u2019s main hall. This would let us know about support for this idea. Also, we had to change the strategy in the middle of the data collection since the PiCamera stopped working. Our intention there was to count the amount of people going to eat outside during lunchtime compared to the total of people at IAAC. However, we believe this wasn\u2019t a major problem for our research. Materials needed: Picamera, \u201cLunchRoom\u201d poster, Iaac map and personal interviews to people that were heating their food in the microwave or eating in the classrooms.

REFLECTION I want to have a place to eat lunch inside IAAC Are all spaces in IAAC in use? Yes, but it depends on the day time. By the data we collected at lunch time we saw that at that time, most spaces were empty and some occupied by the master\u2019s students but regarding to each students master\u2019s classrooms with a camera stick to Ruben\u2019s body. As for example, MDEF classroom was occupied by MDEF students, some ate there or in the main hall tables around the kitchen. After lunch, we recollected some more data by going around with the camera and saw that all the spaces were occupied by master classes or office things. We too, put the camera on the entrance to recollect data of how many people entered Iaac after lunch, but the video stopped unexpectedly and we lost that data. So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lunch time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/06-Tech-Beyond-The-Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"Tech Beyond the Myth Forensic Report: Princess Induction Cooker Group Data Recollection Data insights","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/06-Tech-Beyond-The-Myth/#forensic-report-princess-induction-cooker-group","text":"::: Forensics of obsolescence confronts us with the results of today\u2019s consumers\u2019 electronics industry model.

So with some help of how to recover the data, the today day morning, we made a \u201cLunchRoom\u201d fake poster of using the main hall as a lunch space and put it on the entrance to see people\u2019s reactions and if they were interested on joining. During the process of collecting this data, watching people through the camera, we collected that 49 of people in average didn\u2019t looked at all, 15.5 in average looked, and 15.5 in average stopped to read. We reflect that maybe the spot were we put the poster, wasn\u2019t the best spot to it because there is more quantity of people that didn\u2019t looked compared to the ones that did. Maybe if we had more time, we could change the spot to another one like in the bathroom or in another space that people is obligated to look; such as the gender expression group that selected the bathroom and at a simple view, they had a lot of reactions. So, instead of using a camera because of privacy if we choose the bathroom, we could make a more interactive intervention of people expressing how they feel about not having a lunch space, or were do they eat or if they like to occupy a space to have lunch, or maybe if they want to join to make the rooftop a more capable space to have lunch. This take us to other questions regarding to the exercise of choosing a hypothesis sauce as, could we change the rooftop for this purpose?, were people eat during lunch time?, how many people don\u2019t eat at iaaac because ther is no common space?","title":"Data insights"},{"location":"Term1/seminars/07-The-Almost-Useless-Machine/","text":"The Almost Useless Machine \u00b6 HOW HAPPY DO YOU WANNA FEEL TODAY?_ :) \u00b6 FABRICATION_ \u00b6 OUR USELESS MACHINE_ :) \u00b6 https://youtu.be/wdrpc9YuWf8 WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED 2 DO?_ \u00b6 Create an almost useless machine based on recycled materials from other machines, in particular those that we had dismantled the previous week, mega entertaining.

For two years now, I have immersed myself in the world of research into materials based on organic waste. Bio-threads as such can be created with sodium alginate and calcium chloride, together with water. Pigments or other waste can be added to help its formation. I had never tried to create bio-threads before, since last December I participated in a workshop with an Argentine researcher named Carolina Etchevers. After this workshop, my interest in continuing to explore biothreads intensified and now I would like to continue exploring them. Lara has a project called \u2018Be Grounded\u2019 that she did for Fabriacademy in 2019 where she knitted seeds into yarn filaments. That made me wonder if it would be possible to create natural-based threads that could grow food plants to be able to create street sculptures and occupy public spaces to be able to cultivate. Below, my first try of making bio-threads. Here some of Lara\u2019s work: And Carolina Etchevers work: This are more experimentations w/ bio-threads but in this case as part of Lara Campos biomaterials class & group experimentation. Part of how could I imagine this kind of sculptures is based on Robert Cannon\u2019s work \u2018Terraform\u2019 2010. But, this sculptures are very sophisticated more than what I\u2019m looking for. Actually, I wish I could try to create earthen structures where the bio-threads could get tangled up and plants could grow. I am not looking for these sculptures to fall into the aesthetic, on the contrary, I seek to produce accessible food for everyone with them. We could use chicken wire or even go completely organic and use natural straws to form the structure of whatever we want our food sculpture to be. In addition to that, materials such as compost and soil, such as seeds, are necessary for this type of intervention to be carried out. Also, instead of creating living sculptures, living garments could be created just like Lara did. But considering that these garments, after their useful life, are completely degradable since they will be created with biothreads and seeds.

We did our reserch w/ some documents Laura shared to us, for it to be more fast and have in mind the data that we recollected. Ruben & I joined for this workshop, because we have an intervention to create living sculptures that produce food. We digressed a bit in terms of creating materials themselves, to experiment with whether food can be germinated in biomaterials. Before all experimenting and creating new materials, we created a plan that made sense to us in order for it to work and that the seeds germinate in our material. We developed 4 methods to experiment with biomaterial and see which of all could work. As shown below, we experimented be putting the soil below the biomaterial (experiment A1), then the soil on top and seeds below of the biomaterial and again soil in experiment A2. After it we decided to experiment with spreading water on the material seed, biomaterial, soil. And on experiment C, we tried to be more creative and instead of using a cup/ petridish we used chicken wire. Our samples in our molds: We did a bigger scale of our experiment and got out of the petri dishes to see if seeds grow on sculpture made out of soil (shown below). After a week and three days of watching if there would be any progress on germintation, we realized that the temperature in which the samples are, is not favorable for the seeds to germinate.
